# Philosophy 
TODO: Intro + elaborate about the philosophy behind Ubigia.

# Why? - Philosophical perspective.
- *Technological Entropy.*<br/>
  Today’s technology trends reach a tipping point beyond which innovation speed drastically decreases and complexity increases.

- *Moving towards The Invisible Computer.*<br/>
  We just don’t seem to be able to make IT ‘ready-at-hand’ instead of ‘present-at-hand’

- *IT has become a goal in itself.*<br/>
  That is until the first organization breaks the cycle and adds value without todays enormous costs involved.

# Why? - Business perspective.
- *The Digital Wasteland.*<br/>
  The exponential increase of data silo’s is getting out of control.

- *Our hunger for Next-Gen applications.*<br/>
  Virtual Private Assistants, Mixed Reality, Artificial Intelligence, Digital Twin, Internet of Things – they all require a level of information complexity that is difficult to realize/grasp.
  
- *Uncharted business cases.*<br/>
  Service Enhancing Technologies, The Future of Work & many more!

# How? - Philosophical perspective.
- *Think out of the box.*<br/>
  What concepts do we all take for granted but aren’t actually?

- *Think BIG!*<br/>
  How are IT trends related and how do we make sense of them all?
- *Think beyond.*<br/>
  It is OK to doubt the limitations set by todays technology or ‘proven’ concepts/theorems. 

# How? - Fundamental principles.
- *Information is always multi-dimensional.*<br/>
  Take this as a starting point.
  
- *Information should be Immutable by-design.*<br/>
  “All roads lead to Rome” - i.e. the same outcome can be reached by many methods or ideas.
  
- *Context is key.*<br/>
  The purpose of any IT system is to support its users in some task(s). This means that information system’s should provide information as good as possible for the context the user is in.
  
# What? - Conceptual: Information Layer Architecture instead of data silo oriented.
- *Ubiquitous Information System.*<br/>
  In which all information is stored, secured and  interlinked.
  
- *Application - silo’s - on top.*<br/>
  Adapters for legacy applications working alongside advanced next-gen applications.
  
- *This is not a data lake!*<br/>
  A data lake doesn’t honor information relations as firs-class information.

# What? - Conceptual: Multi-Dimensional information
All possible information can be modelled using three symmetrical dimensions:

- *Temporal*<br/>

- *Sequential*<br/>

- *Hierarchical*<br/>

# What? - Conceptual: Immutable Information.
- *Most of today’s data systems are based on mutable information.*<br/>
  This is an ‘ancient’ concept that originated a few decades ago.
  
- *Temporal relations should be first-class citizens in any data system.*<br/>
  Not doing so increases complexity exponentially in time.
  
- *Immutable Information opens up new possibilities.*<br/>
  Easier information structuring/exchange (including CAP theorem workaround) and many more.
  
# What? - Conceptual: All information should be absolutely identifiable.

- *Even temporal information should be uniquely identifiable.*<br/>
  This will separate the concerns of information exchange and need for conflict resolution when using information across multiple devices.
  
- *How?*<br/>
  Secret sauce: Just use identifiers that include location and time.
  
- *Split the concerns of Information Persisting and Information Registration – these are not the same.*<br/>
  Preparation of identifiers can happen way before using them.
