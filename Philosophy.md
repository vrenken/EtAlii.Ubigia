# Philosophy 
TODO: Intro + elaborate about the philosophy behind Ubigia.

## Why? - Philosophical perspective.

> :information_source: **_SUMMARY:_**
> - *Technological Entropy.*<br/>
>  Today’s technology trends reach a tipping point beyond which innovation speed drastically decreases and complexity increases.
>
> - *Moving towards The Invisible Computer.*<br/>
>   We just don’t seem to be able to make IT ‘ready-at-hand’ instead of ‘present-at-hand’
> 
> - *IT has become a goal in itself.*<br/>
>   That is until the first organization breaks the cycle and adds value without todays enormous costs involved.

## Why? - Business perspective.
- *The Digital Wasteland.*<br/>
  The exponential increase of data silo’s is getting out of control.

- *Our hunger for Next-Gen applications.*<br/>
  Virtual Private Assistants, Mixed Reality, Artificial Intelligence, Digital Twin, Internet of Things – they all require a level of information complexity that is difficult to realize/grasp.
  
- *Uncharted business cases.*<br/>
  Service Enhancing Technologies, The Future of Work & many more!

## How? - Philosophical perspective.
- *Think out of the box.*<br/>
  What concepts do we all take for granted but aren’t actually?

- *Think BIG!*<br/>
  How are IT trends related and how do we make sense of them all?
- *Think beyond.*<br/>
  It is OK to doubt the limitations set by todays technology or ‘proven’ concepts/theorems. 

## How? - Fundamental principles.
- *Information is always multi-dimensional.*<br/>
  Take this as a starting point.
  
- *Information should be Immutable by-design.*<br/>
  “All roads lead to Rome” - i.e. the same outcome can be reached by many methods or ideas.
  
- *Context is key.*<br/>
  The purpose of any IT system is to support its users in some task(s). This means that information system’s should provide information as good as possible for the context the user is in.
  
## What? - Conceptual: Information Layer Architecture instead of data silo oriented.
- *Ubiquitous Information System.*<br/>
  In which all information is stored, secured and  interlinked.
  
- *Application - silo’s - on top.*<br/>
  Adapters for legacy applications working alongside advanced next-gen applications.
  
- *This is not a data lake!*<br/>
  A data lake doesn’t honor information relations as firs-class information.

## What? - Conceptual: Multi-Dimensional information
All possible information can be modelled using three symmetrical dimensions:

- *Temporal*<br/>

- *Sequential*<br/>

- *Hierarchical*<br/>

## What? - Conceptual: Immutable Information.
- *Most of today’s data systems are based on mutable information.*<br/>
  This is an ‘ancient’ concept that originated a few decades ago.
  
- *Temporal relations should be first-class citizens in any data system.*<br/>
  Not doing so increases complexity exponentially in time.
  
- *Immutable Information opens up new possibilities.*<br/>
  Easier information structuring/exchange (including CAP theorem workaround) and many more.
  
## What? - Conceptual: All information should be absolutely identifiable.

- *Even temporal information should be uniquely identifiable.*<br/>
  This will separate the concerns of information exchange and need for conflict resolution when using information across multiple devices.
  
- *How?*<br/>
  Secret sauce: Just use identifiers that include location and time.
  
- *Split the concerns of Information Persisting and Information Registration – these are not the same.*<br/>
  Preparation of identifiers can happen way before using them.
  
## What? - Conceptual: Contextual Views using Micro Schema Composition.
- *A user’s view on information is dynamic.*<br/>
  Provide a view that slides across information and broadens or narrows depending on the required (and changing) context.
  
- *Information interlinking should not be limited.*<br/>
  Instead applications should be able to find out how to interpret information.
  
- *Dynamic Hierarchical Schematics.*<br/>
  Application access information using a dynamic composition of small schema’s they understand. 
  
## What? - Conceptual: Multi-Dimensional Traversal Language.
- *We need a new way to work with information.*<br/>
  There is need for an information retrieval/alteration approach that is native to the multi-dimensional character of information.
  
- *Flow and stream based information access.*<br/>
  Querying information should not merely return a snapshot in time - Accessing a context should also provide access to possible changes.
  
- *Facilitating compatibility.*<br/>
  Traditional systems should be facilitated and also able to run on top of a Ubiquitous Information System.
  
## What? - Conceptual: Subscription based Information Exchange.
- *Blockchain/DLT powered.*<br/>
  To ensure that when needed information cannot be replicated.
  
- *You are in control.*<br/>
  Share information permanently/once/for a period or even based on a specific ruleset.
  
- *Highly needed to solve the problem of IoT.*<br/>
  And doing so trigger a paradigm shift in information ownership.
  
## What? - Conceptual: Benefits
- *Next-gen business use-case complexity will become feasible.*<br/>
  Indexing will become a thing of the past. Exchanging information ”as easy as pie”.
  
- *Interlinking different types of information will become easy.*<br/>
  Enabling advanced use cases in which 3D, tasks details, collaboration and numerous information sources can finally be combined.
  
- *Manageable Industrial Data Platforms and Industry 4.0.*<br/>
  Subscription based information exchange will change the flow of value.
  
- *Fully structured information.*<br/>
  Which will greatly benefit any Artificial Intelligence application.

- *Scaling the Internet of Things.*<br/>
  Not having to worry about information replication and the corresponding security will greatly reduce the complexity of IoT setups.
  
- *Security will become easier.*<br/>
  Reduction in the impact of breaches. Eventually a breach will no longer result in permanent damage.

## What? - POC / Use Case 1 – Personal Photo Collection
- Full personal photo archives are made available in a truly ‘usable’ way.
- Intelligently accumulates other information sources like: 
  - Contact details, time, usage + behavioral patterns.
  - Conversations: Email, Facebook, WhatsApp, phone calls.
  - Location: Photo/device location, car location, travel details.

- Searching can be done naturally.<br/>
  When was I last in Berlin? Who was also there at that moment? How did I travel? What conversations are related to this trip?

- Visualization is done on desktop, touch and glass devices – including AR/VR.

## What? - POC Use Case 2 – Personal Contextual Assistant/assistance.
- Knowledge workers are assisted with applications that run on top of a Ubiquitous Information System.

- Selected types of business information are stored and interlinked:<br/>
  Email, LinkedIn, personal information, project information, documents, indoor/outdoor location, information wrt colleagues, office building related information.

- The system provides advice, additional context and processes tasks when requested. 

- Integration is done as deeply in a user’s devices as possible.
