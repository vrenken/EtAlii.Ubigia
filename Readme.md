# Introduction 
Ubigia is a philosophy and corresponding family of technologies and applications with as aim to better facilitate information ownership, exchange and entanglement.
It's intent is not to be yet another NoSql database, but rather to expand the boundaries of digital information by applying (or better said re-inventing) some of the fundamentals we all take for granted in today's information systems. 

## Getting Started

1. Anyone curious about the guiding principles behind Ubigia and how it came into existence might find the "[Philosophy](http://github.com/vrenken/EtAlii.Ubigia/blob/master/Philosophy.md)" pages interesting.
2. People that just want to learn by making their hands dirty could start witg our "Getting started" guides.
3. People interested in the architecture, implementation, how Ubigia works and everything related should check out the "How stuff works" set of pages.

## TODO


In 2012 I've come to the conclusion that the way we think about digital information is fundamentally flawed,
or better said based on decades of digital progress that has clouded our vision
