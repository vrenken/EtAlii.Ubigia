# Introduction 
Ubigia is a philosophy and corresponding family of technologies and applications with as aim to better facilitate information ownership, exchange and entanglement.
It's intent is not to be yet another NoSql database, but rather to expand the boundaries of digital information by applying (or better said re-inventing) some of the fundamentals we all take for granted in today's information systems. 

## Getting Started

1. Anyone curious about the guiding principles behind Ubigia and how it came into existence might find the "Philosophy" pages interesting.
2. People interested in the architecture, implementation and how it works should check out the "How stuff works" set of pages.
   -	Installation process
   -	Software dependencies
   -	Latest releases
   -	API references
3. People that just want to learn by making their hands dirty could start witg our "Getting started" guides.







In 2012 I've come to the conclusion that the way we think about digital information is fundamentally flawed,
or better said based on decades of digital progress that has clouded our vision  
 
#Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

#Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

#Contribute
TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better.
