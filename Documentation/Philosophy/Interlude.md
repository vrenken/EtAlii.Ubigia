# Ubigia - A Philosophical Interlude. 
The thoughts on which Ubigia is build started way back in 2012 (in Italy to be precise). This page describes the philosophical thought experiments from that early era using a why/how/what principle. Reason is foremost that we don't want to fall in the patterns and practices that are keeping current information systems from evolving, but want to both understand the fundamental reason for this project and - as it'll be a long project - need thorough and strong guiding principles to fall back on along the road. 

## Why? - Philosophical perspective.
Today's world is directly entangled with information technology trends. However, many IT innovations are reaching a tipping point in that the required information systems and corresponding exchange cannot keep up anymore. Systems get more and more complex, but the added value is no longer in contrast with the complexity needed to achieve it. 

In parallel another trend is the ongoing quest towards better user interfaces, not only using conventional 2D applications running on screens but lately also in the form of chat/voice assistants and 3D VR/AR/MR applications. But almost - if not all - variations don't succeed in elevating computing appliances to the next level in regards how 'natural' they are. There seems to be something missing in making them more ‘[ready-to-hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heideggerian_terminology#Ready-to-hand)’ and less ‘[present-at-hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heideggerian_terminology#Present-at-hand)’. Somehow it feels that many of today's UX endeavors and communities have accepted the general limitations of IT and scoped their goals to make the best of it without attempting to break the limitations they put on users.  
Combined with the commercial world that surrounds IT it can even be speculated that software development in general is more and more becoming a goal on itself. New versions with better - and more - features, increased performance, new ways to express/personalize but far less focussed on breaking fundamental barriers that are holding back IT from becoming something better. This effect is especially noticeable in all Digital Transformation activities that show the wonders of for example Machine Learning without truly showing the disadvantages/increased complexity/costs such technologies introduce.

## Why? - Business perspective.
Of course the effects mentioned in the previous part should be seen from a commercial perspective. However, if it is commercially the right choice it doesn't mean it will bea  feasible long-term strategy. Especially today's common accepted approach to information storage and exchange is something that can be considered flawed from both a business, societal and environmental point-of-view. It just isn't logically to just create new information silo's without understanding that such an approach won't scale in any way. 
The question that can be read in these kind of thoughts is if the current way of structuring and exchanging information can be replaced with something else. And if so, with what? One simple answer is that an exponentially growing set of data also requires an exponentially growing set of compute to understand it.  

Surely there are cloud approaches and data-lakes, but none of them try to approach and solve the problem fundamentally. In essence the whole Internet is based on making countless duplicates of the same information, and verifying and re-transferring them when they got changed. In today's world where sustainability is a hot topic it just feels absolutely illogical to duplicate information infinitely, without asking weither or not there are better ways to share and use information. Not only email, information on social networks and other personal/business information sources are prone for duplication and ever-increasing complexity, but all organizational and knowledge and information stored on the internet gets restructured, replicated, backed up and can often be found within and outside the scope of expected operation. It feels like the Internet and the connected set of global information systems is slowly transforming into a Digital Wasteland.

Yet still, Digital Transformation is still being pushed tremendously and through virtual private assistants (the machine-version, not the human one), Machine Learning, any variation of the Digital Twin concept, and even the Internet of Things promotes an increased need for new, better ways of storing and exchanging information. Simly said, all of tomorrow's innovations require more complex information models than we currently are able to grasp with conventional information thinking, which makes it very difficult to realize them with tools build using the same mindset.

Folowing this stream of thought it seems that most - if not  all - of the futuristic user interfaces that get presented in the science fiction movies and TV series just won't be achievable without a fresh wave of thinking. We're teased and excited with a fascinating era that lies of ahead of us but up until now (11-2020) nobody has been able to unlock the door to the other side of the paradigm and enable its promised potential.

## How? - Philosophical perspective.
So, if change in information thinking is neccesery, how do we achieve it? The approach taken with Ubigia is to *doubt everything*. The human mind is engineered to accept things that just work, but to introduce groundbreaking new concepts it's wise to reflect on all concepts and principles we all take for granted. In case of this project this boils down to analysing and re-interpreting some of the basic abstract principles that make up digital information. Which ones will be explained further on this page.

Also, as Ubigia is not meant as a commercial product but as a concept with which to make the (digital) world a better place we should think big: There is no need to introduce a limiting - yet lucrative - mindset. Doing so  will only shroud judgement and cause suboptimal conclusions and decisions and probably influence the result of the project for the worse. Thinking big might also be daunting, as the solution might rise up to solve multiple (related) problems, but scaling down or dividing the problem into multiple facets is probably easier than patching impossible problems afterwards. The current mindset related to think big is that ownership, exchange and storage of information is currently done suboptimal, and heavily influencing the advancements done with machine learning. The current set of ML methodologies most often work on unstructured text and/or raw image/video material. There are very few (if any) solutions that allow machine learning to truly **CONTINUE**  

Another driver is not to stop at the current technical limitations of technologies...

## How? - Fundamental principles.
- *Information is always multi-dimensional.*<br/>
  Take this as a starting point.
  
- *Information should be Immutable by-design.*<br/>
  “All roads lead to Rome” - i.e. the same outcome can be reached by many methods or ideas.
  
- *Context is key.*<br/>
  The purpose of any IT system is to support its users in some task(s). This means that information system’s should provide information as good as possible for the context the user is in.
  
## What? - Conceptual: Information Layer Architecture instead of data silo oriented.
- *Ubiquitous Information System.*<br/>
  In which all information is stored, secured and  interlinked.
  
- *Application - silo’s - on top.*<br/>
  Adapters for legacy applications working alongside advanced next-gen applications.
  
- *This is not a data lake!*<br/>
  A data lake doesn’t honor information relations as firs-class information.

## What? - Conceptual: Multi-Dimensional information
All possible information can be modelled using three symmetrical dimensions:

- *Temporal*<br/>

- *Sequential*<br/>

- *Hierarchical*<br/>

## What? - Conceptual: Immutable Information.
- *Most of today’s data systems are based on mutable information.*<br/>
  This is an ‘ancient’ concept that originated a few decades ago.
  
- *Temporal relations should be first-class citizens in any data system.*<br/>
  Not doing so increases complexity exponentially in time.
  
- *Immutable Information opens up new possibilities.*<br/>
  Easier information structuring/exchange (including CAP theorem workaround) and many more.
  
## What? - Conceptual: All information should be absolutely identifiable.

- *Even temporal information should be uniquely identifiable.*<br/>
  This will separate the concerns of information exchange and need for conflict resolution when using information across multiple devices.
  
- *How?*<br/>
  Secret sauce: Just use identifiers that include location and time.
  
- *Split the concerns of Information Persisting and Information Registration – these are not the same.*<br/>
  Preparation of identifiers can happen way before using them.
  
## What? - Conceptual: Contextual Views using Micro Schema Composition.
- *A user’s view on information is dynamic.*<br/>
  Provide a view that slides across information and broadens or narrows depending on the required (and changing) context.
  
- *Information interlinking should not be limited.*<br/>
  Instead applications should be able to find out how to interpret information.
  
- *Dynamic Hierarchical Schematics.*<br/>
  Application access information using a dynamic composition of small schema’s they understand. 
  
## What? - Conceptual: Multi-Dimensional Traversal Language.
- *We need a new way to work with information.*<br/>
  There is need for an information retrieval/alteration approach that is native to the multi-dimensional character of information.
  
- *Flow and stream based information access.*<br/>
  Querying information should not merely return a snapshot in time - Accessing a context should also provide access to possible changes.
  
- *Facilitating compatibility.*<br/>
  Traditional systems should be facilitated and also able to run on top of a Ubiquitous Information System.
  
## What? - Conceptual: Subscription based Information Exchange.
- *Blockchain/DLT powered.*<br/>
  To ensure that when needed information cannot be replicated.
  
- *You are in control.*<br/>
  Share information permanently/once/for a period or even based on a specific ruleset.
  
- *Highly needed to solve the problem of IoT.*<br/>
  And doing so trigger a paradigm shift in information ownership.
  
## What? - Conceptual: Benefits
- *Next-gen business use-case complexity will become feasible.*<br/>
  Indexing will become a thing of the past. Exchanging information ”as easy as pie”.
  
- *Interlinking different types of information will become easy.*<br/>
  Enabling advanced use cases in which 3D, tasks details, collaboration and numerous information sources can finally be combined.
  
- *Manageable Industrial Data Platforms and Industry 4.0.*<br/>
  Subscription based information exchange will change the flow of value.
  
- *Fully structured information.*<br/>
  Which will greatly benefit any Artificial Intelligence application.

- *Scaling the Internet of Things.*<br/>
  Not having to worry about information replication and the corresponding security will greatly reduce the complexity of IoT setups.
  
- *Security will become easier.*<br/>
  Reduction in the impact of breaches. Eventually a breach will no longer result in permanent damage.

## What? - POC / Use Case 1 – Personal Photo Collection
- Full personal photo archives are made available in a truly ‘usable’ way.
- Intelligently accumulates other information sources like: 
  - Contact details, time, usage + behavioral patterns.
  - Conversations: Email, Facebook, WhatsApp, phone calls.
  - Location: Photo/device location, car location, travel details.

- Searching can be done naturally.<br/>
  When was I last in Berlin? Who was also there at that moment? How did I travel? What conversations are related to this trip?

- Visualization is done on desktop, touch and glass devices – including AR/VR.

## What? - POC Use Case 2 – Personal Contextual Assistant/assistance.
- Knowledge workers are assisted with applications that run on top of a Ubiquitous Information System.

- Selected types of business information are stored and interlinked:<br/>
  Email, LinkedIn, personal information, project information, documents, indoor/outdoor location, information wrt colleagues, office building related information.

- The system provides advice, additional context and processes tasks when requested. 

- Integration is done as deeply in a user’s devices as possible.
